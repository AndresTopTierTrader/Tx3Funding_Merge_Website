- **Translation** - Jose Salazar  
- **Thumbnail** - Renata Martinez
- **Code** - Developer
- **Deploy** - Developer

### File Locations

The necessary files for blog implementation are distributed across different tasks:

- **Blog copy**: Located in the Translation task (available once translation is complete)
- **Thumbnail and graphics**: Located in the Thumbnail task (available once design is complete)

## Other Tasks

All tasks are typically divided into multiple subtasks, such as design, code, copy, and other specialized components. 

### Navigating Task Structure

To get a comprehensive view of your work:

1. **Check the Board Column** - Within your assigned task, locate and click on the `Board` column
2. **Access the Full Task Board** - This will take you to the complete task board where you can see all related subtasks for a single project
3. **Review Dependencies** - Pay attention to subtask relationships, as some subtasks may depend on the completion of others

### Understanding Task Dependencies

When reviewing the task board, note that subtasks often have dependencies. A subtask may be blocked until another team member completes their portion of the work. Always check these relationships to plan your work accordingly.
